// Why you need to map an array ?

// In React you need to map an array to add HTML elements to the data and return a list of JSX elements
// Generally mapping allows you to iterate over the elements and apply a function or transformation to each one.

// Why we need keys during mapping an array ?

// Keys help React indentify which corresponding DOM elements have changed, were added or removed
// Keys should be unique and consistent between renders

// What is the importance of destructuring your code ?

// Destructuring allows to asign values of objects directly to variables, this allows access without repetitive syntaxwrite

// Does destructuring make your code clean and easy to read ?

// Yes, it makes the intentions clear by immediately exposing the variables of interest
