// A module is a set of functions that can be exported, imported and used in a react project.

// What is package

// A package is a set of modules with metadata and dependencies.

// What is the difference between a module and a package.

// A module is a single JS file that contains one or more functions. 
// A package is a folder of module files and comes with a package.json file that provides metadata.

// What is NPM

// NPM (Node Package Manager) is a comman line tool used to install Node.js packages.

// What is Webpack

// Webpack is used to bundle modules required for a web application to function properly into a single bundle.js file.
// Webpack can bundle not only JavaScript files but also other assets like CSS, images, and more. 
// This improves performance when working on web apps with many imports.

// How do you create a new React project

// CDN: Import ReactDOM and babel.js in a HTML file
// CLI: User the create-react-app tool

// What are the files and folders inside a project folder(package.json, package-lock.json or yarn.lock, .gitignore,node_modules and public)

// package.json contains metadata and dependencies
// package-lock.json is used to lock dependency versions
// .gitignore contains patterns of which files not to track when using git
// node_modules contains the modules required for the application (e.g. ReactDOM and more)
// public contains public files served with the application

// What is your favorite code editor (I believe that it is Visual Studio Code)

// I long worked with Sublime Text and have now switches to VSCode.
// Not entirely sure yet.

// Add different Visual Studio Code extensions to improve your productivity(eg. prettier, ESLint etc).

// Allready did that. Was the first move when switching to VSCode.

// Try to make a different custom module in a different file and import it to index.js.

// See the level1 folder for details
